	abstract = {The discovery that macroorganisms can be detected from their environmental DNA (eDNA) in aquatic systems has immense potential for the conservation of biological diversity. This special issue contains 11 papers that review and advance the ﬁeld of eDNA detection of vertebrates and other macroorganisms, including studies of eDNA production, transport, and degradation; sample collection and processing to maximize detection rates; and applications of eDNA for conservation using citizen scientists. This body of work is an important contribution to the ongoing efforts to take eDNA detection of macroorganisms from technical breakthrough to established, reliable method that can be used in survey, monitoring, and research applications worldwide. While the rapid advances in this ﬁeld are remarkable, important challenges remain, including consensus on best practices for collection and analysis, understanding of eDNA diffusion and transport, and avoidance of inhibition in sample collection and processing. Nonetheless, as demonstrated in this special issue, eDNA techniques for research and monitoring are beginning to realize their potential for contributing to the conservation of biodiversity globally.},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA sampling (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting aquatic animals. Previous research suggests that eDNA methods are substantially more sensitive than traditional sampling. However, the factors inﬂuencing eDNA detection and the resulting sampling costs are still not well understood. Here we use multiple experiments to derive independent estimates of eDNA production rates and downstream persistence from brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in streams. We use these estimates to parameterize models comparing the false negative detection rates of eDNA sampling and traditional backpack electroﬁshing. We ﬁnd that using the protocols in this study eDNA had reasonable detection probabilities at extremely low animal densities (e.g., probability of detection 0.18 at densities of one ﬁsh per stream kilometer) and very high detection probabilities at population-level densities (e.g., probability of detection N0.99 at densities of ≥3 ﬁsh per 100 m). This is substantially more sensitive than traditional electroﬁshing for determining the presence of brook trout and may translate into important cost savings when animals are rare. Our ﬁndings are consistent with a growing body of literature showing that eDNA sampling is a powerful tool for the detection of aquatic species, particularly those that are rare and difﬁcult to sample using traditional methods.},

Eradication is one of the most effective tools for the management of invasive species but has important economic and ecological tradeoffs and its success needs to be carefully monitored. We assessed the eradication success of the topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), an invasive fish that poses significant risks to endemic aquatic fauna, in four ponds previously treated with the piscicide Rotenone using a novel qPCR‐based environmental DNA (eDNA) assay. We validated the assay through successfully detecting DNA from topmouth gudgeon in two reservoirs with physically confirmed topmouth gudgeon populations. Topmouth gudgeon were detected in all four treated ponds using 750 ml water samples and in three of the ponds using 15 ml samples, despite the eradication treatment and lack of successful detection using conventional trapping methods. Our results highlight the difficulties of eradicating invasive fish and the need to incorporate reliable monitoring methods as part of a risk management strategy under the water framework directive (WFD).},

	abstract = {Machine learning heavily relies on data, but realworld applications often encounter various data-related issues. These include data of poor quality, insufficient data points leading to under-fitting of machine learning models, and difficulties in data access due to concerns surrounding privacy, safety, and regulations. In light of these challenges, the concept of synthetic data generation emerges as a promising alternative that allows for data sharing and utilization in ways that real-world data cannot facilitate. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of existing studies that employ machine learning models for the purpose of generating synthetic data. The review encompasses various perspectives, starting with the applications of synthetic data generation, spanning computer vision, speech, natural language processing, healthcare, and business domains. Additionally, it explores different machine learning methods, with particular emphasis on neural network architectures and deep generative models. The paper also addresses the crucial aspects of privacy and fairness concerns related to synthetic data generation. Furthermore, this study identifies the challenges and opportunities prevalent in this emerging field, shedding light on the potential avenues for future research. By delving into the intricacies of synthetic data generation, this paper aims to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and inspire further exploration in synthetic data generation.},

	abstract = {Fish communities in the Camargue wetlands, both temporary and permanent marshes as well as irrigation and drainage canals, were studied from 1977 to 1980. The main part of this work was carried out in wetlands isolated from direct contact with the sea by a dike, the Digue à la mer. Three major types of wetlands and their associated fish species are described in the Camargue : the freshwater (0-5 g/1 C1￣ ), the brackish (5-16 g/1 C1￣ ) , and the very brackish (16-35 g/1 C1￣ ) . A significant relationship (P{\textless} 0.01) was found between the species richness and the surface area. The slope of this regression (0.134) is lower than that found for other aquatic systems. Four associations of fish were determined and their meaning is discussed. The biomass of temporary freshwater marshes ranged between 13 to 76 kg/ha and was much lower than those found in the small freshwater canals : 112 to 2 544 kg/ha. Common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., is the dominant species in freshwater wetlands (70 to 85 \% of total biomass). A space partitioning between the immature and the adult carp is described. In one waterbody studied south of the Digue à la mer, linked temporarily with the sea, the fish community composition underwent frequent and rapid changes according to the variations of environmental factors. The salinity appeared to be the most important factor affecting diversity and eveness of the fish community in this etang. A canonical analysis was used to determine which of the environmental factors had the greatest impact on the abundance of the different fish genus. Only 46.2 \% of the fish species studied reproduce in the Camargue, while 35.9 \% migrate to the sea for spawning. The importance of a link with the sea as well as that of a sound water management plan for the Camargue as a whole are pointed out.},

Within this group, one species in particular, Sphareothecum destruens, also known as the rosette agent, represents a major risk to global aquatic biodiversity and aquaculture, and has caused severe declines in wild ﬁsh populations in Europe and large losses in salmon farms in the USA. It is a species that has been associated with a healthy carrier for millions of years, but in recent decades, the host has managed to invade parts of Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Europe, and North Africa. In order to better understand the emergence of this new disease, for the ﬁrst time, we have synthesized current knowledge on the distribution, detection, and prevalence of S. destruens, as well as the associated mortality curves, and the potential economic impact in countries where the healthy carrier has been introduced. Finally, we propose solutions and perspectives to manage and mitigate the emergence of this fungus in countries where it has been introduced.},

The aim of this study was to improve the knowledge on DNA persistence in water in order to confirm the presence of the focus species in freshwater ecosystems. Aquatic vertebrates (fish: Siberian sturgeon and amphibian: Bullfrog tadpoles) were used as target species. In control conditions (tanks) and in the field (ponds), the DNA detectability decreases with time after the removal of the species source of DNA. DNA was detectable for less than one month in both conditions. The density of individuals also influences the dynamics of DNA detectability in water samples. The dynamics of detectability reflects the persistence of DNA fragments in freshwater ecosystems. The short time persistence of detectable amounts of DNA opens perspectives in conservation biology, by allowing access to the presence or absence of species e.g. rare, secretive, potentially invasive, or at low density. This knowledge of DNA persistence will greatly influence planning of biodiversity inventories and biosecurity surveys.},

In this study, we evaluated the effect of sample processing on the detection of a species’ environmental DNA in the water. Speciﬁcally, we examined whether freezing and then thawing water samples prior to analysis was an effective method of preserving them. The detection of Common Carp DNA was lower in samples that were frozen and thawed than in samples that were not, even though there was no difference in the DNA concentration, which was included with the DNA undetectable samples. In both types of samples, the DNA detection rate tended to be higher in a 2-lL volume of template DNA solution than in a 5-lL volume. DNA was detected in all non-frozen samples that were analyzed using a 2-lL template, both in three wells (three PCR replicate reactions per sample) with 40 PCR cycles and in eight wells with 55 cycles. The detection of Common Carp DNA in samples that were frozen and thawed was likely to increase through the use of the TaqMan Environmental Master Mix, which is used recently to efﬁciently release PCR inhibition. Our results suggest that environmental DNA detection is inﬂuenced by the processing of water samples after collection and by PCR reaction conditions. Use of non-frozen samples and a smaller DNA solution are recommended for detection of environmental DNA with quantitative PCR assays.},

We developed an assay to target a 90 base pair sequence of Chinook DNA and used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to quantify the amount of Chinook eDNA in triplicate 1-L water samples collected at 48 stream locations in June and again in August 2012. The overall probability of detecting Chinook with our eDNA method in areas within the known distribution was 0.77 (±0.05 SE). Detection probability was lower in June (0.62, ±0.08 SE) during high ﬂows and at the beginning of spring Chinook migration than during base ﬂows in August (0.93, ±0.04 SE). In the Methow subbasin, mean eDNA concentration was higher in August compared to June, especially in smaller tributaries, probably resulting from the arrival of spring Chinook adults, reduced discharge, or both. Chinook eDNA concentrations did not appear to change in the Okanogan subbasin from June to August. Contrary to our expectations about downstream eDNA accumulation, Chinook eDNA did not decrease in concentration in upstream reaches (0–120 km). Further examination of factors inﬂuencing spatial distribution of eDNA in lotic systems may allow for greater inference of local population densities along stream networks or watersheds. These results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of eDNA detection methods for determining landscape-level distribution of anadromous salmonids in large river systems.},

	abstract = {Genetic identiﬁcation of aqueous environmental DNA (eDNA) provides site occupancy inferences for rare aquatic macrofauna that are often easier to obtain than direct observations of organisms. This relative ease makes eDNA sampling a valuable tool for conservation biology. Research on the origin, state, transport, and fate of eDNA shed by aquatic macrofauna is needed to describe the spatiotemporal context for eDNA-based occupancy inferences and to guide eDNA sampling design. We tested the hypothesis that eDNA is more concentrated in surﬁcial sediments than in surface water by measuring the concentration of aqueous and sedimentary eDNA from an invasive ﬁsh, bigheaded Asian carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.), in experimental ponds and natural rivers. We modiﬁed a simple, low-cost DNA extraction method to yield inhibitor-free eDNA from both sediment and water samples. Carp eDNA was 8–1800 times more concentrated per gram of sediment than per milliliter of water and was detected in sediments up to 132 days after carp removal – ﬁve times longer than any previous reports of macrobial eDNA persistence in water. These results may be explained by particle settling and/or retarded degradation of sedimentadsorbed DNA molecules. Compared to aqueous eDNA, sedimentary eDNA could provide a more abundant and longer-lasting source of genetic material for inferring current-or-past site occupancy by aquatic macrofauna, particularly benthic species. However, resuspension and transport of sedimentary eDNA could complicate the spatiotemporal inferences from surface water sampling, which is currently the predominant eDNA-based approach. We discuss these implications in the context of conservation-oriented monitoring in aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The European weather loach (Misgurnus fossilis) represents one of many European freshwater ﬁshes in decline. Efﬁcient monitoring is essential if conservation efforts are to be successful, but due to the species’ cryptic biology, traditional monitoring methods currently in use are inefﬁcient, time consuming and likely prone to non-detection error. Here, we investigate the usefulness of environmental DNA (eDNA) monitoring as an alternative or supplementary method for surveying the Danish weather loach population, which is presumed to consist primarily of a single group of no more than 50 individuals. In 2008, the majority of historical Danish localities were surveyed, using traditional ﬁshing techniques. We then applied eDNA methods to a number of these, as well as other potential localities. We successfully detected the weather loach at multiple sites in the single known remaining locality; a result that was later conﬁrmed when local managers caught eight live specimens. Furthermore, the eDNA method indicated presence of the weather loach in another historical locality, where the species has not been observed since 1995. At the remaining localities, weather loach eDNA was not detected, providing further evidence for its absence. Importantly, the eDNA survey required less effort in person-hours and lower costs than the traditional ﬁshing survey. This study conﬁrms that eDNA monitoring is a valid supplement to traditional monitoring methods currently applied to monitor rare freshwater ﬁshes. We propose that by providing reliable distribution data at lower cost and limited effort, the eDNA method can allow for increased management efﬁciency of endangered freshwater species such as the European weather loach.

The nanopore provides a highly confined space within which single nucleic acid polymers can be analyzed at high throughput by one of a variety of means, and the perfect processivity that can be enforced in a narrow pore ensures that the native order of the nucleobases in a polynucleotide is reflected in the sequence of signals that is detected. Kilobase length polymers (single-stranded genomic DNA or RNA) or small molecules (e.g., nucleosides) can be identified and characterized without amplification or labeling, a unique analytical capability that makes inexpensive, rapid DNA sequencing a possibility. Further research and development to overcome current challenges to nanopore identification of each successive nucleotide in a DNA strand offers the prospect of `third generation' instruments that will sequence a diploid mammalian genome for {\textasciitilde}\$1,000 in {\textasciitilde}24 h.},

	abstract = {Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION sequencer was launched in pre-release form in 2014 and represents an exciting new sequencing paradigm. The device offers multi-kilobase reads and a streamed mode of operation that allows processing of reads as they are generated. Crucially, it is an extremely compact device that is powered from the USB port of a laptop computer, enabling it to be taken out of the lab and facilitating previously impossible in-field sequencing experiments to be undertaken. Many of the initial publications concerning the platform focused on provision of tools to access and analyse the new sequence formats and then demonstrating the assembly of microbial genomes. More recently, as throughput and accuracy have increased, it has been possible to begin work involving more complex genomes and metagenomes. With the release of the high-throughput GridION X5 and PromethION platforms, the sequencing of large genomes will become more cost efficient, and enable the leveraging of extremely long ({\textgreater}100 kb) reads for resolution of complex genomic structures. This review provides a brief overview of nanopore sequencing technology, describes the growing range of nanopore bioinformatics tools, and highlights some of the most influential publications that have emerged over the last 2 years. Finally, we look to the future and the potential the platform has to disrupt work in human, microbiome, and plant genomics.},
